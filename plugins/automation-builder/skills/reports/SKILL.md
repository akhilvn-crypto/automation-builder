# /automation-builder:reports

Setup asks which reports you want once. This command changes that choice whenever you like, without running the pipeline: turn a
report off, add another, or both in one go. It changes **only** the reports (and the evidence and report mode they imply); every
other setting stays as saved. It runs no tests and installs nothing by itself.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` (`show` = only list what is on now and stop).

You (the main session) run this; it asks questions, so it cannot run in a subagent. Read
[../playwright-pipeline/environment.md](../playwright-pipeline/environment.md) first (asking in Claude Code and Cowork, project root).
Every state change goes through `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts`; never edit `automation/config/automation.config.json`
or `automation/playwright.config.*` by hand.

> **Project setup:** if `dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts` does not exist, stop and tell the user to run
> `/automation-builder:init` first. If the project has no saved configuration yet (`config check` says `absent`), stop and tell
> them to run `/automation-builder:playwright-pipeline` (or `do-automation`) once: the reports are chosen in its setup.

## 1. Show what is on now

Run `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config show` and read `config.reporters`. Show one compact list, in this order, using
these names (never `json`: it is always produced because the pipeline reads it):

| Report | `reporters` value |
|---|---|
| Playwright default report | `html` |
| Allure report | `allure` |
| Extent report | `extent` |
| Evidence PDF | `evidence-pdf` |

Mark each as **on** or **off**. `junit` may appear in an older config: mention it in one line as "kept as saved, no longer offered".
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `show`, stop here.

## 2. Ask for the new selection

One `AskUserQuestion` with a single **multiSelect** question and exactly these four options (never preselect any, never add
`None`). Label each option with its current state, e.g. `Allure report (on now)` / `Extent report (off now)`. The dialog cannot
tick boxes in advance, so say so in the question itself:

> *"Which reports do you want from now on? Pick every report you want; anything you leave unpicked is turned off."*

Option descriptions (same wording as setup):
- **Playwright default report**: the standard Playwright HTML report. Needs nothing.
- **Allure report**: needs `allure-playwright` and the Allure CLI, each approved separately.
- **Extent report**: one self-contained HTML file: dashboard, searchable test list, steps, errors, screenshots. Built by the
  pipeline, needs no package, and is **not** the ExtentReports library (that is Java/.NET; no maintained Playwright-for-Node
  version exists). Say that.
- **Evidence PDF**: one PDF with the executed steps, ONE video of each test's whole journey embedded, and ONE final-state
  screenshot. Cost: **every** test is video-recorded (passing ones too) and Chromium prints the PDF.

If the dialog is unavailable, use the numbered chat fallback from environment.md and show the current state as `[x]` / `[ ]`; ask the
user to reply with the numbers of the reports they want on (or `none`).

**An empty answer is not a decision.** If nothing was picked, ask one confirm question, *"Turn off all reports? Only the JSON
results the pipeline reads would be kept."* (*Yes, turn them all off* / *No, keep what I have*), and stop on *No*.

## 3. Preview, then confirm

Run (nothing is saved without `--apply`):

`node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config reporter-update --reporters <comma list of the picked values, or none>`

- Unknown action (the CLI answers with the list of `config <…>` actions without `reporter-update`): the project's engine is older
  than this command. Tell the user to run `/automation-builder:init --update` and then repeat this command; do nothing else.
- `issues` present (exit 2): show them and stop; change nothing and do not hand-edit around them.
- `changed: false`: say that this is already the current selection and nothing was changed. Stop.

Otherwise tell the user, briefly: what is **added**, what is **removed**, and each line of `changes` (the mode and evidence follow
from the selection: Evidence PDF → audit mode with video on for every test, Allure → full, otherwise standard), the software in
`reportPlan.missing` (named, not yet installed), and any `notes`. Then:

- If a removed Evidence PDF reset `evidence.video` and the resulting mode is not `standard` (Allure is still on), offer to keep
  recording every test (`--video on`); in `standard` that is not allowed, so do not offer it.
- If `unfinishedRuns` is not empty, say: *"These runs are not finished: <ids>. Each keeps the reports it started with, but
  Playwright's own report settings are refreshed from the saved choice, so a report you removed may show as failed when such a run
  builds its reports. New runs are not affected."* Offer to apply now anyway or cancel to finish those runs first.

Ask one confirm question: *Apply these changes (Recommended)* / *Cancel*. Never apply without the yes.

## 4. Apply

`node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config reporter-update --reporters <same list> [--video on] --apply`

This saves through the same validation as `config save` and refreshes `automation/playwright.config.*`. Read the result:

- `applied: false` with `issues`: report them and stop.
- `playwrightConfig.status: "kept"`: the user edited that file by hand, so the new reports were **not** written into it. Show
  `detail` and let them choose: update it themselves, or `config render --force` (overwrites their edits; ask first).
- `reportPlan.missing` not empty: handle each missing item exactly as `pipeline-setup` §3 says: **one approval per dependency**,
  explain what it is for and the exact `installCommand` (run from inside `automation/`), install only on that yes, then re-run
  `preflight`, and record it with `deps record --dependency <id> --action installed|declined … ` (no `--run` when no run is active).
  Before proposing Allure, check the current official Allure guidance (Allure 3 CLI is the npm `allure` package; Allure 2 needs
  Java) and state the runtime requirement in the question. After `allure-playwright` is installed run
  `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config render`. If the user declines an item, the report stays selected but cannot be
  produced (it will show `missing_dependency`): say so, and that running this command again can turn it off.
- Evidence PDF: remind that Chromium prints it and every test is recorded; ffmpeg is optional and never installed without the user's
  yes (see `test-reporting`).

## 5. Say what happens next

Close in a few lines:
- The reports now on (names only, plus where they appear: `automation/reports/<runId>/…`, see `test-reporting`).
- **When it takes effect:** each run reads the saved choice when it starts (its `configuration` stage), so it applies from the **next**
  run (`/automation-builder:run-tests`, `/automation-builder:playwright-pipeline`, `/automation-builder:do-automation`). Reports of runs that
  already finished are not rebuilt or removed. Reports the user turned off stay on disk where earlier runs wrote them.
- Anything still waiting on them (a declined install, a hand-edited `playwright.config`).

Never claim a report will be produced unless `reportPlan.missing` is empty. Never put secret values anywhere.

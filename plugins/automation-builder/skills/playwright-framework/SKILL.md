# Playwright framework conventions

One framework for every agent. Do not create parallel configs, fixtures or helpers.

Paths are relative to **`automation/`** (the framework, with its own `package.json`). The engine, test-case input and run state
live in the sibling `dependencies/`; never put them in `automation/`. `<ext>` is `ts` or `js`: the language chosen at
`/automation-builder:init` (`language` in `dependencies/state/scaffold.json` and in `run show <runId>`).
**Write only that language.** Never mix, never convert.

## Layout

`pages/`, `tests/`, `helpers/` are mandatory; `fixtures/`, `config/`, `test-data/`, `auth/`, `reports/`, `test-results/` exist
only with a clear responsibility. No other top-level folders in `automation/`.

| Path | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `playwright.config.<ext>` | framework (user-editable) | standard `defineConfig`, literal values written from `config/automation.config.json` by `config save`/`config render`; a hand-edited file is never overwritten without `--force`. Don't edit it from generated tests or healing |
| `fixtures/test.<ext>` | framework | exports `test`, `expect`; auto `diagnostics` fixture attaches console/page/network errors on failure; auto `stepEvidence` fixture (only with the `evidence-pdf` reporter) screenshots every `test.step` and the final state, masking password fields |
| `helpers/test-data.<ext>` | framework | `requireEnv(name)`, `requireWorkerEnv(name, parallelIndex)`, `uniqueSuffix(prefix, workerIndex?)`, `redact()`; generic helpers only, page behaviour belongs in `pages/` |
| `test-data/` | humans | non-sensitive data files only, never credentials |
| `pages/BasePage.<ext>` | framework | base class (`path`, `open()`, `byTestId()`) |
| `pages/<Name>Page.<ext>` | generator | page objects extending `BasePage`, named for the page, shared across modules |
| `tests/<module>.spec.<ext>` | generator + humans | every test, **one file per module**. A pipeline-written file starts with `// @automation-builder:generated` and is the only kind it regenerates or heals; files without it are handwritten and never modified. Never overwrite a file lacking the header: choose another name |
| `auth/*.setup.<ext>` | generator | only for `auth.approach = storage-state`: logs in once, saves `auth/storage-state.json` (git-ignored, never commit) |
| `reports/`, `test-results/` | generated | output per run (`<runId>/<label>/`); never write source here |
| `../dependencies/engine/` | plugin | never edit |

TypeScript projects type-check with `npm run typecheck` (needs `@playwright/test`); JavaScript ones are syntax-checked and
reviewed statically. Import specifiers carry the real extension (`.ts` / `.js`). TypeScript uses only erasable syntax (no enums,
namespaces or parameter properties).

## Modules: one test file per module

Specs belong to modules (`module`/`moduleSlug` in `test-specs.json`). **Every module has its own file and a file holds one module
only.** Get the plan from `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts specs modules <runId>`: per module the file to write
(`tests/<moduleSlug>.spec.<ext>`, or `tests/<moduleSlug>.generated.spec.<ext>` when a handwritten test has that name), the spec IDs
to generate and the ones to hold back. Use exactly those names. Wrap the tests in one `test.describe('<module name>', …)`.

Page objects are named for the page (`LoginPage`, `ProjectFormPage`), not the module; two modules using one page import the one
class, and a cross-module flow uses the other module's page object, never a copy of its locators. `generate validate` fails
when a file mixes modules or a module is split over files.

## Page objects

- Use one when the same page's locators/actions appear in **two or more** tests, or one page has three or more interactions;
  otherwise keep locators inline.
- One class per page/component in `pages/<Name>Page.<ext>`, extending `BasePage`: `readonly` locator properties built from
  `this.page` in the standard locator order, and methods for user *actions* (`signIn()`, `addToCart()`).
- **Assertions never go in page objects**; they stay in the test, mirroring the spec's expected results.
- Build locators only from exploration evidence. Navigate with a relative `path`, never an absolute URL.
- List every page object added or changed in the generation manifest's `sharedFilesChanged`; the reviewer applies the
  line-level safety rules to it. The healer does **not** auto-patch page objects (shared): report the defect for user approval.

## Test shape

TypeScript (`tests/login.spec.ts`; the first line is the ownership header):

```ts
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/test.ts';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage.ts';
import { requireEnv } from '../helpers/test-data.ts';

test.describe('Login', () => {            // one describe per file: the module's name
  test('[TC-001] Valid user can sign in', { annotation: { type: 'testId', description: 'TC-001' }, tag: ['@smoke'] }, async ({ page }) => {
    const login = new LoginPage(page);
    await test.step('Open the login page', async () => {
      await login.open();                                // BasePage.open() → page.goto(path) relative to baseURL
    });
    await test.step('Enter credentials', async () => {
      await login.signIn(requireEnv('TEST_USER_EMAIL'), requireEnv('TEST_USER_PASSWORD'));
    });
    // Expected: The heading "Dashboard" is visible
    await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Dashboard' })).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

JavaScript is identical minus the types, with `.js` specifiers; page objects declare `path = '/login'` as a class field and use
JSDoc (`/** @param {string} email */`).

Rules:
- Title **starts with `[<testId>] `** and the `testId` annotation is set; results, triage and healing rely on it.
- Import `test`/`expect` from `fixtures/test.<ext>`, never from `@playwright/test`.
- One `test.step` per spec step, in the spec's wording; the spec's expected result as a comment above each assertion.
- With the `evidence-pdf` reporter (check `run show <runId>`), wrap each expected result's assertions in
  `await test.step('Expected: <expected result, spec wording>', async () => { … })` so the PDF shows that check with the
  screenshot taken right after it. The assertion itself is unchanged; only the wrapper is added. Without that reporter keep
  the comment-above-assertion form. Use `test.step` from the shared fixture, and never take screenshots by hand: the fixture does.
- Spec tags → Playwright `tag` (`@smoke`); priority may go in an annotation.
- Locators in order: `getByRole` (with name) → `getByLabel` → `getByPlaceholder`/`getByText` → `getByTestId` → a scoped
  `locator()` as a last resort, with a comment saying why. Never XPath, structural CSS or CLI refs (`e12`).
- Web-first assertions (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveText`, `toHaveURL`). No `waitForTimeout`; no `isVisible()` inside an `if`.
- Assertions match the spec's expected results exactly (same quoted text, same URL fragments); add none for unstated behaviour.
- No `.only`, `test.skip`, `test.fixme`, `test.fail`, `@ts-ignore`, or `force: true` (unless evidence is noted in a comment).
- Each test is independent: no order dependence, no shared mutable state, a fresh context per test.
- Create data with `uniqueSuffix()` and clean it up in the test (or `afterEach` when a cleanup path exists); never delete data
  the test didn't create.

## Execution settings

`use.baseURL`, `video`, `screenshot`, `trace`, `retries`, `workers`, `timeout` and browser projects come from
`config/automation.config.json` (plus `PW_*` env overrides). Don't hard-code them in tests; change them via the pipeline-setup skill.

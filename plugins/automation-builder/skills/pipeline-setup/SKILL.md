# Pipeline setup

Resolves the `preflight` and `configuration` stages. All state goes through the CLI; never hand-edit
`automation/config/automation.config.json`, `dependencies/state/dependency-log.json` or a manifest.

CLI: `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts <args>` (JSON on stdout; exit 0 ok, 2 validation failed/not ready, 1 error).
Run it from the project root. The project has two sibling folders: `automation/` (the Playwright framework — config
paths below are relative to it) and `dependencies/` (the pipeline engine, test-case input, run state). Packages install
into `automation/` (the only folder with a `package.json` dependency list and `node_modules`), so run every
`installCommand` as `cd automation && <installCommand>`.

## 1. Preflight (read-only)

Run `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts preflight`. It never installs anything. Read `checks[]` and `config`.

- `node` status `error` → stop; the user must upgrade Node manually.
- Report a compact table: dependency, status, version, location, required.

## 2. Configuration

Run `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config check`.

Precedence, low → high: built-in defaults (non-material only: browsers=chromium, retries=1, timeout, healing cap=2) →
`automation/config/automation.config.json` → env vars `PW_BASE_URL`, `PW_ENVIRONMENT`, `PW_BROWSERS` (comma list),
`PW_WORKERS`, `PW_RETRIES` → explicit command arguments. Material choices (language, evidence, reporters, base URL,
input path, auth) are never defaulted silently.

- `status: "valid"` and no `--reconfigure` → **reuse it**. Show a 3–5 line summary. Do not re-ask.
- `absent` / `invalid` → ask **only** for the fields listed in `issues` (plus any the user wants to change).

Rules for asking (use the AskUserQuestion dialog; group independent choices into one call, max 4 questions). If the tool is
not callable, is deferred, or fails, ask the same questions as a numbered list in chat and wait for the reply: see
[../playwright-pipeline/environment.md](../playwright-pipeline/environment.md) ("Asking the user"), which also covers Claude Cowork.

- **Every question needs 2–4 options** (the tool rejects the whole call otherwise, and the user never sees it).
  When there is only one candidate value — e.g. a base URL found in a test case — never send it as a one-option
  question and never add a filler option. Ask a confirm question instead: *"Use `<value>` as `<field>`?"* with
  options *Yes, use as-is (Recommended)* and *No, I'll give a different value* (the user types it via Other).
  A genuinely free-text field with no candidate is asked in plain chat, not with AskUserQuestion.
- If a call is rejected with `InputValidationError`, do not repeat it unchanged: fix the offending question and
  re-ask. Do not re-ask questions the user already answered.

| Field | How to ask | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | **Do not ask here and do not infer it from tsconfig/devDependencies.** It was chosen by the user at `/automation-builder:init` and is recorded in `dependencies/state/scaffold.json` (preflight shows it as `scaffold.language`); the CLI seeds it into the config and rejects a different value. Only if `scaffold` is `null` (a folder not created by init) stop and tell the user to run `/automation-builder:init`. | chosen at init |
| `evidence.video` | off / on / retain-on-failure | retain-on-failure |
| `evidence.screenshot` | off / on / only-on-failure | only-on-failure |
| `evidence.trace` | off / on / on-first-retry / retain-on-failure | retain-on-failure |
| `reporters` | **Ask which reports the user wants** as one multiSelect with exactly these four options (never preselect any): **Playwright default report** (`html`: the standard Playwright HTML report), **Allure report** (`allure`; needs `allure-playwright` and the Allure CLI, each approved separately), **Extent report** (`extent`) and **Evidence PDF** (`evidence-pdf`). `json` is mandatory (pipeline state), so add it yourself and never offer it; `junit` is no longer offered (an older config that has it stays valid). Only the selected reports are produced. Then run `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config reporter-preset --reporters <comma list of the selected ones, or none>` (nothing is saved) and use its `reporters`, `evidence`, `reporting` and `needs` as the proposal: **the mode is derived from the selection, so do not ask for it** (evidence PDF → `audit` with step evidence and `evidence.video: "on"`; Allure → `full`; otherwise `standard`). Describe each choice: *Extent report* = one self-contained HTML file with a dashboard (pass/fail chart, per-module and failure-category breakdowns), a searchable, filterable test list and, per test, the test-case steps, expected results, errors and screenshots (the executed steps too when the evidence PDF is also selected); it is built by the pipeline from the run results, needs no package, and is **not** the ExtentReports library (that one is Java/.NET and no maintained Playwright-for-Node integration exists), so say that when offering it. *Evidence PDF* = the custom evidence report: one PDF that lists the executed steps (result, duration, error) and, per test, ONE video of the whole journey embedded in the PDF plus ONE screenshot of the final state, with the expected results and failures; it does **not** take a screenshot per step. Say what it costs: every test (passing ones too) is video-recorded, and Chromium is used to print the PDF (no extra package). Ask the three `evidence.*` questions after this one, proposing the preset's `evidence`: the user's answers win except that the evidence PDF needs `evidence.video: "on"`, and `standard` rejects record-everything evidence (the CLI says so on save). `config mode-preset <standard|full|audit>` still shows a mode on its own | none preselected |
| `browsers` | multiSelect chromium/firefox/webkit | chromium |
| `app.baseUrl`, `app.environment` | Free text. **Never invent a URL.** Must be an authorized test environment. | — |
| `input.testCasesPath` | Path relative to `dependencies/`. **Don't ask in `/playwright-pipeline`:** the orchestrator already asked where the test cases are and imported them into `input/test-cases`, so use that. Ask only when no import happened (e.g. `/generate-tests` with the files already placed by hand) | `input/test-cases` |
| `auth.approach` | none / ui-login / storage-state; `credentialEnvVars` = env var **names** only. Don't ask for credentials or their names: those in the test cases are created in `automation/.env` by `specs parse` and redacted automatically, so `credentialEnvVars` may be `[]` | — |
| `auth.state` | Only for storage-state: `probePath` (a path on the app that needs login; ask the user, never guess; it lets the pipeline confirm a saved session is still accepted before the run; the login step re-checks it anyway, so this is optional), `maxAgeHours` (default 8), `loggedOutPattern` (regex for a logout redirect). Optional | probePath if the user knows one |
| `execution.isolation` | Only when more than one worker is wanted: `serial` (tests change shared data), `shared-readonly` (they never do), `per-worker-accounts` (one login per worker: `NAME_1..NAME_N` in `automation/.env`, needs ui-login). Unanswered = tests in a file run in order | serial if unsure |
| `cleanup` | **Ask whether the tests should remove the data they create** (it is changed by running them, so ask once in setup; never default it): offer **exactly two options**: *Sweep — remove it once, after every test has finished* = `mode: "sweep"` (tests keep what they create, so a later test can still use it; needs a declared delete API or UI path per entity, otherwise it is only listed — say so; offer it first when tests depend on each other's data) and *Test — remove it in each test, right after that test finishes* = `"test"` (the test's own undo runs; nothing runs after the whole run). Do not offer a third choice; if the user declines both, save no `cleanup` block (the run still lists what it created). `allowedEnvironments` = the `app.environment` you are running against (confirm it is **not** production: the CLI refuses prod/production/prd/live whatever is configured). Do **not** ask for or guess delete endpoints: only if the user volunteers one, save it as `cleanup.entities.<entity>.api` (`method`, `path` with `{id}`, optional `headersFromEnv` = env var **names**, optional `verifyPath`); how to delete through the UI (`cleanup.entities.<entity>.ui.hint`) is added when the test cases or the explorer show it. Say what each choice does to the user's data before they pick. Saved with `config save` like any other field | none: asked (no cleanup block until the user picks) |
| `execution.workers` | Leave unset (a conservative default of 2) unless the user wants a number. More workers only after `run compare` shows no test got worse | unset |

To change the reports after setup, the user runs `/automation-builder:reports` (no run needed); do not re-ask them mid-pipeline.

Briefly mention storage cost: `on` for video/trace on every test is large; failure-only keeps evidence focused.
`evidence-pdf` is independent of `evidence.screenshot`: its one final-state screenshot per test is always taken (password fields and
`reporting.maskSelectors` are masked, visible page data is not), so the screenshot mode only controls Playwright's own failure
screenshot. It embeds one execution video per test, so it **requires `evidence.video: "on"`** (the config is rejected otherwise;
`config mode-preset audit --evidence-pdf` sets it). Say so when proposing it: every test is recorded, and the videos are not masked. If the user picks `evidence-pdf` without `chromium` in `browsers`, preflight adds a `browser:chromium` requirement
(purpose "Render the evidence PDF"), approved like any other dependency. Standard mode rejects record-everything evidence
(`on` for video/screenshot/trace); full and audit allow it. `config report-plan` lists the software the chosen reporters need and
which of it is missing; it never installs anything.
Extent report: built by the pipeline (`extent-report.ts`), not by a package; see `test-reporting`.

Write the candidate to a scratch JSON file, then `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config save --file <path>`.
Save as soon as the answers are in, before any install or exploration: a saved config is checkpointed on disk, so
a resumed run reuses it instead of asking again.
If exit code 2, show `issues` and re-ask only those fields. Never put secret values in the config —
secrets live in `automation/.env` (git-ignored); `automation/.env.example` lists names only.
The save also writes the choices into `automation/playwright.config.*` (a standard Playwright config the user may edit).
If the output says `playwrightConfig.status: "kept"`, the user edited that file by hand: tell them the new settings were
not applied to it (show `detail`) and let them choose between updating it themselves or `config render --force`.

## 3. Dependencies — one approval per dependency

Re-run preflight after configuration (required-ness depends on config). The `secrets-ignored` check fails when `.env` or `auth/storage-state*.json` are not covered by `automation/.gitignore` while the configuration uses credentials or saved login state: have the user add them (do not edit `.gitignore` silently). For **each** check with
`required: true` and `status: "missing"`, in this order: `typescript` (only required for a TypeScript scaffold), `@playwright/test`, `browser:*`,
`@playwright/cli`, `allure-playwright`, `allure-cli`:

1. Explain: what is missing, why (`purpose`), the exact `installCommand`, and that it is project-local and version-pinned.
2. Ask a yes/no question for **that dependency only**. Approval never extends to another dependency.
3. **Declined** →
   `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts deps record --dependency <id> --action declined --reason "<purpose>" --run <runId>`,
   set the current stage `blocked` with the reason, and stop. Tell the user how to resume:
   `/automation-builder:playwright-pipeline resume <runId>` after installing or approving.
4. **Approved** → run exactly `installCommand` (from inside `automation/`), re-run preflight to verify the check is now `ok`, then
   `deps record --dependency <id> --action installed --version <verified> --cmd "<command>" --reason "<purpose>" --run <runId>`.
   If verification fails, report the output and mark the stage `failed`. Do not try alternatives.

Special cases:
- `@playwright/cli` found only **globally** is acceptable (`status: ok`). You may *offer* a project-local pinned
  install for reproducibility; it is optional.
- Before proposing any Allure install, check current official Allure guidance (Allure 3 CLI is the npm
  `allure` package; Allure 2 needs Java). Explain the runtime requirement in the question.
- After an approved `allure-playwright` install run `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts config render`, so the
  reporter is added to `playwright.config.*` (it is listed there only once the adapter can be loaded).
- Before proposing the Playwright CLI install, check current official `@playwright/cli` guidance for the install
  command and compatibility with the installed `@playwright/test` version.

## 4. Done

Preflight `ready: true` and config `valid` ⇒ stage may complete. Otherwise the stage is `blocked`
(missing approval/info) or `failed` (an operation errored) — never `completed`.

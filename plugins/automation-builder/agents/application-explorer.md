# application-explorer

**Purpose:** observe the real application for each ready spec so the generator can use verified, durable locators.

**Inputs:** `runId` and your brief `dependencies/runs/<runId>/briefs/exploration.json` (only the test cases to explore or revalidate and the pages
to snapshot); `app.baseUrl` and `exploration.tool` from the run's config (`node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts run show <runId>`);
`dependencies/runs/<runId>/test-specs.json`. Explore only specs with `status: "ready"`.

**Permitted work**
- Drive the browser with the tool named in the config, following the application-exploration skill: one named
  session `explore-<runId>` (the name must contain the run id), a snapshot before acting, each spec's steps in order, and the session
  closed at the end, also when you stop early or hit an error. Finish with `pipeline.ts cleanup run <runId>` and report its result
  (`ok`, `stillRunning`). Never run `close-all` or `kill-all`: they end browsers that are not this run's.
- Use credentials only through the environment variables named in a spec's `testData[].envVar`. Never echo them,
  write them to files, or keep them in saved snapshots. Their values are in `automation/.env`, which your shell does not
  load: run steps that need them with `pipeline.ts env run -- sh -c '… "$VAR" …'` (see the application-exploration skill).
  If a name has no value, stop and report it: the orchestrator tells the user to fill it in `automation/.env`.
- Start from `explore plan <runId>`: explore only the specs it marks `explore`. The orchestrator has already run `explore snapshot <runId>`, which
  revalidates what a headless snapshot can prove, so your brief lists only the pages it could not prove (redirected, or a locator that may need an
  interaction to appear): for those, `revalidate` means take one snapshot per listed page and call
  `explore revalidate` (see the skill's *Reuse* section). Saved observations are never trusted without that snapshot, except for specs the plan
  marks `covered` (a still-current generated test exists): leave those alone, they need no work from you.
- For specs marked `explore`, start from the brief's `knownPages`: confirm a known page you reach with one snapshot + `explore revalidate`, then
  reference it as `"pageId": "saved:<key>"` in `fresh.json` (listing only locators that came back `present`) instead of re-observing and re-listing
  it. Explore fresh only what is new (see the skill's *Known pages*).
- A spec with `dependsOn` needs what its prerequisites leave behind (a project one of them created, an account another registered). Explore the
  prerequisites' steps first, in the order given, in the same session, then the dependent case's steps. Record only what you really did and saw. If a
  prerequisite cannot be completed, mark the dependent entry `blocked` and name the prerequisite in its `uncertainties`.
- If a step creates a record, register it with `pipeline.ts cleanup record <runId> --entity <kind> --identifier <name or id> --hint "<where it is
  deleted in the UI>"` (see the skill), so the data you made while exploring is removed with the run's test data. Record only what you created.
- Every locator you put in a step's `locators` must also be listed in that page's `elements` (with role, name and confidence), including each
  repeated control such as `.nth(0)`…`.nth(5)` of an OTP field. `explore assemble` refuses a record where a step names a locator its page does not list.
- Write only under `dependencies/runs/<runId>/exploration/`: `fresh.json`, `*.aria.yml` snapshots, `*.png` screenshots. `exploration.json`,
  `exploration-plan.json`, `revalidation.json` and the observation store are written by the CLI.
  Run the Playwright CLI from `dependencies/`, never from `automation/` (the framework folder stays free of session files).

**Not permitted**
- Destructive or irreversible actions (delete, pay, place orders, send emails/messages, change account settings, bulk
  operations) unless the spec requires it **and** the orchestrator passes explicit user authorization. Record each
  skipped action in `avoidedActions`.
- Recording CLI element refs (`e12`, `ref=e12`) as locators. Translate every observation into a semantic locator.
- Inferring expected behaviour the spec doesn't state. Record surprises in `uncertainties`.
- Installing anything or switching to a different browser automation stack.

**Output:** `exploration/fresh.json` (schema: `engine/pipeline/exploration.ts`), then
`node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts explore assemble <runId>` (writes `exploration/exploration.json`) and `explore validate <runId>` must
exit 0. Final message: per-spec status (explored / partial / blocked) and whether it was explored fresh or reused (with the plan's reason),
key uncertainties, avoided actions, and the validate result.

**Completion criteria:** every ready spec has an entry, `partial`/`blocked` entries explain why in `uncertainties`,
and `explore validate` exits 0. If the app is unreachable or login fails, stop and report it as an environment or
precondition problem. Don't keep retrying.

name: data-cleaner
description: Removes test data that a run created and that can only be removed through the application's UI (config.cleanup.entities.<entity>.ui), one listed record at a time, and reports each result with `cleanup resolve`. Used only when `cleanup data` returns `uiTasks`. Never deletes anything that is not on that list.

# data-cleaner

**Purpose:** remove the records a run created when no API is declared for them, so the environment is left as it was found. The run's ledger
is the only authority on what may be deleted.

**Inputs:** `runId` and the `uiTasks` from `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts cleanup data <runId>`: for each task an `id`, the `entity`, the
`identifier` (the unique name or id the test gave it), `how` (where and how it is removed in the UI) and the `testId`. Nothing else: no logs, no
earlier conversation. `app.baseUrl` and `app.environment` come from `run show <runId>`.

**Before you start:** if the environment is a production one (`prod`, `production`, `prd`, `live`) or `cleanup data` reported `ran: false`, stop and
say why; the CLI does not hand out tasks in those cases, so this should not happen. If there are no tasks, do nothing.

**Procedure (per task, one after another)**
1. Use one named browser session whose name contains the run id (`cleanup-<runId>`), opened at the base URL with the tool the config names
   (see the application-exploration skill; run it from `dependencies/`). Log in only through env vars (`pipeline.ts env run -- …`, see the skill);
   never print a value.
2. Follow the task's `how` to the screen that lists the record. Find it by its **exact identifier**. If the page shows no match, or more than one,
   do not delete: resolve the task as `failed` with a note ("record not found" / "several matches").
3. Open that one record and use its delete/remove control. If a confirmation dialog names a different record, cancel it and resolve as `failed`.
4. Check it is gone (a fresh snapshot of the list no longer shows the identifier). Then report:
   `node dependencies/engine/cli/pipeline.ts cleanup resolve <runId> <task id> --status verified_gone` (seen gone) or `--status deleted` (the app said
   it was deleted but you could not check), or `--status failed --note "<what happened, no secrets>"`.
5. Close the session, then run `pipeline.ts cleanup run <runId>` (nothing of the run may stay running) and `pipeline.ts cleanup status <runId>`.

**Not permitted**
- Deleting any record that is not a listed task, "select all", bulk or search-and-delete, emptying a list, or deleting a record whose identifier
  you only partly matched.
- Guessing a delete URL or API endpoint, changing account or app settings, creating anything, or editing tests, config or the ledger by hand.
- Retrying a failed deletion more than once, or continuing after the app behaves unexpectedly (a different page, an error, an unexpected dialog):
  resolve as `failed` with the reason and move on.
- Installing anything, or using `close-all` / `kill-all`.

**Output (final message):** per task `id`, entity, identifier and the status you reported; then the `cleanup status` counts and any `leftovers`
with how they can be deleted. A task you could not finish is a normal outcome, not an error: the user gets the list.
